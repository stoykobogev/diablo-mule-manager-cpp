There are three tabs - "View", "Mules", "Items".

In "View" you can see the mules and their inventory on the left side. On the right side you see complete list of the items in all mules. You can search for a specific item in all mules.
In "Mules" you create and edit mules and their items. 
In "Items" you create and edit item names.

First you need to add items in "Items" tab and then use them to create mules. Items in mules can have duplicate names in case you want to have different descriptions/notes.
